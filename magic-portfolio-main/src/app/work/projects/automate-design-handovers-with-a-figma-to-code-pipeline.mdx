## Overview
UnityGrid is an advanced logistical framework designed to bridge the gap between global resource surplus and local disaster needs. By centralizing humanitarian data, UnityGrid ensures that aid reaches the most vulnerable locations—from Istanbul to Tokyo—without delay.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Border Logistics**: Developed a custom Figma plugin that extracts design tokens such as colors, typography, and spacing values, and exports them in a format compatible with our codebase.
- **Specialist Deployment**: Integrated an automated process that translates Figma components into React code using a combination of design tokens and pre-built component templates. This allowed developers to focus more on logic and less on repetitive UI coding.
- **Inventory Resilience**: Established a CI/CD pipeline that continuously synchronizes design changes from Figma to the codebase, ensuring design updates are reflected instantly without manual intervention.

## Technologies Used

- **Architecture**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python.
- **Naming Standards**: Strict adherence to PascalCase for classes (AidCenter, UnityGridEngine) to ensure enterprise-level readability.
- **Data Logic**: Implements dictionary-based inventory mapping for O(1) efficiency in resource updates.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.
