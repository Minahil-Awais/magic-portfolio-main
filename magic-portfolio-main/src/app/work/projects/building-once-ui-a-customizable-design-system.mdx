## Overview

PolyglotNexus is a streamlined, AI-integrated educational dashboard built using the Reflex framework. It is designed to provide a centralized hub for modern learners to manage their digital library, generate study materials via AI, and visualize their academic progress.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Dashboard**: A central landing page featuring progress tracking metrics like "Day Streak" and "Cards Mastered" to motivate daily engagement.
- **Adaptive Navigation**: A responsive UI that utilizes a custom app_sidebar for desktop users and a dedicated mobile_nav menu for smaller screens, ensuring accessibility across devices.
- **AI Generator and Library**: Integrated modules that allow students to create new content dynamically and store it in a persistent digital library for later review.
- **Modular Architecture**: Built with a clean Python structure that separates state management (like StatsState) from UI components, allowing for easy updates and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Reflex (The Core Framework)**: Reflex (formerly Pynecone) is the primary engine behind the app. It allowed to build the frontend and backend entirely in Python.
- **Python 3.12 (The Backend Logic)**: The entire project is written in Python, which manages the application's core logic and structure.
- **Radix UI & Tailwind CSS (The Styling Layer)**: Reflex translated the Python code into these high-performance styling tools.
- **Deployment & DevOps**: The app is moved from the local machine to the web using Reflex's dedicated deployment pipeline.
